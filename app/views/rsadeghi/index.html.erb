			<br/>
			My name is Roya Sadeghi (my official name is Zahra Sadeghi). I graduated from USC in 2009 with a Master of Engineering degree in Electrical Engineering, with focus on Computer Networks. I started working in Cisco as a software Engineer in 2009, mainly focusing on network systems development. I resigned
			from Cisco in 2012 and took independent classes in Web Applications, Web Design and Data Bases. You can browse sections of my resume in this page, or download it <a href="/RoyaSadeghi.pdf">HERE</a>.
			Check out the social photo sharing website that I built on the ruby on rails platform from scratch in the <a href="/user/index">Sample Work</a> section. Now I am looking to switch to a full time web development rule.
